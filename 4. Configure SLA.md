### This configuration sets up IP SLA (Service-Level Agreement) tracking to monitor connectivity to a next-hop IP (10.0.1.2) and dynamically adjust the routing table based on the results.

```
ip sla 1
icmp-echo 10.0.1.2
timeout 5000
frequency 10
exit
ip sla schedule 1 start-time now life forever
no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.1.2
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.1.2 track 1
track 1 ip sla 1
```
---

### Purpose
- Monitors the availability of the next-hop IP (10.0.1.2).
- Automatically removes the default route if 10.0.1.2 becomes unreachable.
- Useful for dynamic failover in static routing scenarios.
