# Key Functions of IP SLA

#### 1. Performance Monitoring:
- Tracks network performance metrics such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and network response time.
#### 2. Proactive Troubleshooting:
- Identifies and resolves potential issues before they affect users.
#### 3. Service Level Monitoring:
- Ensures compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) by monitoring the network's ability to meet predefined performance criteria.
#### 4. Path Selection:
- Helps select the best path for data routing based on real-time performance metrics.
