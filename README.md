# IP_Service_Level_Agreement

IP SLA (IP Service Level Agreement) is a feature provided by Cisco Systems that allows network engineers to monitor and measure the performance of network services in real-time.

# Key Functions of IP SLA

#### 1. Performance Monitoring:
- Tracks network performance metrics such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and network response time.
#### 2. Proactive Troubleshooting:
- Identifies and resolves potential issues before they affect users.
#### 3. Service Level Monitoring:
- Ensures compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) by monitoring the network's ability to meet predefined performance criteria.
#### 4. Path Selection:
- Helps select the best path for data routing based on real-time performance metrics.

# How IP SLA Works
- Simulation: IP SLA generates synthetic traffic, such as UDP, ICMP, or HTTP packets, and sends them across the network to a target device.
- Measurement: The target device (or responder) returns the packets, allowing IP SLA to measure round-trip time (RTT), jitter, and packet loss.
- Reporting: The collected data is stored and analyzed, often integrated with monitoring tools like Cisco Prime or third-party NMS solutions.
